# Week 4

## What I wanted to for this week vs what I actually acheived:

DID: write a first draft, did more research into software engineering processes, do more development, write up user stories

DIDNT: finalise wireframes

## Main talking points + answers:

After reading more research papers, I saw that there are various arguments for requirements engineering being the most important part of the development lifecycle - should I focus on developing a tool to aide in the requirements engineering phase instead of tracking sustainability?

- P: she thinks i can do both requirements phase and app to track sustainability.

In the real world - a lot of teams are maintenance and not development. What does this mean for my app? should i slim down my target audience?

- P: aim at scrum teams instead of kanban - more project focused

Finished user stories - are they sufficient and should I add anything else?

- Sufficient, can add more as we go along with extra stuff - what might we have forgotten or not thought about at this stage? more functionality questions rather than big picture ones.

Ask about backends - planning to use firebase but having second thoughts - what is peggys opinion?

- have a think about backends - is mongoDB a better option?

## What I want to do for next week:

- functioning frontend - proof of concept
- finish wireframes
- if i have time left over - draft up some questions for sustainability dimensions
