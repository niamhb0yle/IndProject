# Meeting 3 - 06/10/23,  15:30-14:00
attendees: Niamh Boyle & Peggy Gregory

## What have I done since last meeting (15 mins)
- created barebones react app (using next.js framework)
- created some very basic wireframes on figma
- imported a wireframe on figma over to app to warm up coding skills
- created an ER-diagram
- brainstormed names


#### MAIN task
thoroughly read through two research papers which gave me a much better understanding of the sustainability dimensions I would like to use to rate the team's scores. Also gave some really good background evidence to justify the need for my product in the dissertation.
Basically strengthened my ideas to a point I am happy with, I can now go on with taking my research to the next level and actually implementing my own framework suitable for the products context.


## General notes from Peggy
- Add peggy to github repo
- I should keep it the simpler the better - try not to overcomplicate the sustainability dimensions
- I should definitely be developing the app in parallel with doing my research
her experience with a software dev team recently brought a few things to attention:
- developers aren't as worried about 'ecological' impact as much as they are worried about racking up technical debt
- biggest way to avoid this is writing easy to maintain code to avoid refactoring or interoperability problems
- (personal note) this could link to the sustainability point of education: maybe if programmers were allowed a better work/life balance they could dedicate more time to keeping up to date with the constantly updating technologies.
- potentially a point that workplaces should be offering learning resources like pluralsight to employees, LOOK INTO THIS


## What I want to have achieved for next week
- finalised wireframes (more focus on functionality than look
- coming up to the end date of my first milestone - planning
- do some research on software engineering process so I can figure out where my app will fit - into the software development lifecycle (ie retros, sprint planning, stand ups)
- write up user stories
- have a first draft of diss intro so I have clear vision
