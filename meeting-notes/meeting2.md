# Meeting 2
## Talking points & answers (summary)

Q: I would like to use React as the web framework to create the site, with a firebase backend, does this sound suitable or do you have other suggestions?

A: Happy with this, best to stick to what you know

Q: still undecided if taking the 'roadmap' or dashboard route, either one will need account creation though. thoughts on a singular account for a whole development team,
or for each team member to be able to have their own account and link it to a 'team'?
To expand, teams would be stored in backend so every member is linked and can view other members progress, could potentially be an easier way for each team member to 
main idea of this is that it will increase accuracy of 'sustainability score' - instead of one scrum master having to put in everyones data each time and potentially getting it wrong

A: Letting each individual team member have an account is a better idea, since people may belong to multiple teams.
Make sure there is functionality for when people may have to move teams.

Q: want to have some kind of metric/scale to measure how sustainable teams are, what do you think the key components of this could be? What sort of measurable inputs can i include?

A: You will have to research this further yourself. Could include certain points from the UN sustainability goals.
Really important to focus on working environment as well - steady workload is actually a facet of being sustainable!
they should focus on being agile as well, there can be a human element to it. sustainability is not just about ecological impact!
Another thing to look at could be some plugins - can i make use of any existing plugins to help with automatic data gathering which can be put into metrics?

## What I did last week
This was my first week of going back into full classes & I was ill so didn't get a lot done, was mainly focused on research and getting my first few sources down.
Had a proper think of how I would like the app to fit into a teams workflow:

1. they set up the team account with all their details and do an initial run through of all the questions
2. at the end of their first sprint with the app, they go through all the questions and answer them. they will then be able to see VISUALLY what they did well and what they could have done better.
3. this repeats every sprint, and when everyone has completed their questions, the team recieves the run down.
4. will try and design it to be quick and easy
5. potentially separate/more team specific questions for the scrum master like data center questions.

## What I want to have acheieved for next week

- had an idea of the 'sustainability score' structure - what different categories can it be made up of
- created barebones app
- decided on a hierarchical structure for teams 
- settled on an MVP
- created wireframes
