##  Problem Identification

<!-- Describe the problem, issue or opportunity that you wish to address with the Project Team.  Explain what you think the underlying cause of the issue is for the team and provide evidence that you have that the problem you have identified is real. You are required to conduct formative assessments of your team's software process: use this to help identify an issue. -->

To identify which issue to address with my team, I referred back to their  [last retrospective (3rd retro)](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2023/sh05/sh05-main/-/wikis/Retrospectives/Third-Formal-Retrospective-17.01.24) (before I started my final coaching exercise planning). From this, it seemed that the main issues were:

- **full team visibility is not great** 
    - Each member seems quite focused on their own tasks, and is not completely aware of what their other team members are doing 
    - 'Some more pair coding sessions for better understanding of what everyone else is doing' - from retrospective conducted 17/01/24
    - There were multiple comments about not knowing what anyone else is doing in all 3 retrospectives ([1st Retro](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2023/sh05/sh05-main/-/wikis/Retrospectives/First-Formal-Retrospective-1.11.23)) ([2nd Retro](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2023/sh05/sh05-main/-/wikis/Retrospectives/Second-Formal-Retrospective-29.11.23))
- **Concerns about dissertation**
    - Noted in the last retrospective 
    - Also brought up verbally at my last meeting with the team
    - Key issues: they are unsure about how to split up the work, as well as how long it will take and what exactly is expected of them

Since I have already introduced stand-ups into their weekly meetings, and could see that the team were planning on running their own pair programming sessions (from the third retro and after speaking with them verbally), I felt it was more important to address the issue of dissertation preparation. 

To adequately prepare for my coaching exercise, I decided to do some further requirements gathering with my team. In [week 14](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2566489b/cst-coursework-2023/-/blob/master/weekly-diary-14.md?ref_type=heads), I asked them specifically which aspects of the dissertation they were unsure about. With their input, I produced this list of topics

- how to pick themes for their dissertation
- help with academic writing
- how to evaluate - differences between describing and evaluating
- referencing in LaTeX and ACM guidance
- how to write about testing

## Description and Justification of PIA

<!-- Describe the PIA you will undertake with the team.  Explain why you think the activity will address the issue you have identified. You can provide references to descriptions of standard practices rather than repeating them in detail.  However, you should outline any customisations you intend to make to a practice. -->
After gathering my exercise learning outcomes in [week 14](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2566489b/cst-coursework-2023/-/blob/master/weekly-diary-14.md?ref_type=heads), I decided that an appropriate exercise to help the team across all of these areas was a 'disseration workshop'. Although this is not a pre-defined agile ceremony or standard group task like pair programming or planning poker, I felt that the unique nature of the requirements called for a more tailored PIA.

To ensure that my workshop covered all bases, I researched  collaborative academic writing practices. I found this paper [1] particularly useful in helping me create my workshop, as it highlighted the key areas I should consider when designing it:

- **Entanglement** - this is the idea that everything in a workshop - the students, tutors, writing process, and even the texts themselves - are all closely connected. What happens in a workshop affects everyone and everything else, making each session unique based on the people involved and their specific needs at that time.
- **Informal can sometimes be better** - the paper argues that whilst a formal workshop can help stay on task, offering informal support also helps adapt to the unpredictable needs of students. For example, if someone is struggling to grasp a concept, I can be flexible with the workshop and spend more time explaining it than going over things they are more comfortable with.
- **Cutting Together-Apart the Thesis** - this concept is about dissecting parts of a thesis (like the introduction or methodology) to understand how they're structured and then thinking about different ways they could be put together. It's a way of helping students see all the possibilities in their writing and encouraging them to explore different approaches.

I also made sure to brush up on my own academic writing skills and LaTeX knowledge through these resources: [ACM referencing](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/reference-formatting), [LaTeX bibliography guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_bibliography_styles), [University academic writing course](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=12927).

As for the actual workshop, I timeboxed it at ~40 minutes. I sent the team my own group disseration from last year to read over before the workshop, so that they could come prepared with any questions. The body of the workshop was made up of three sections, covering the main points from requirements gathering:

1. Dissertation themes and how to identify them (~20 minutes)
    - Work as a group to identify 6 main themes in their project to discuss in the dissertation
2. Crash course in academic writing and Overleaf (~10 minutes)
    - Go over some dissertation writing principles
    - Demonstrate finding an academic source and then adding it to their bibliogaphy in overleaf
3. How to manage and plan their dissertation (~10 minutes)
    - Talk about the importance of incremental writing, ensuring that all team members contribute, and breaking down the dissertation into key sections (cutting together apart theory)

The last 10 minutes were spent answering any questions, as well as setting them their first 'writing task' for the next week. Whilst I can acknowledge that the team have a lot on their plate with the code not being finished and an abundance of deadlines, I encouraged them to integrate writing tasks into their weekly goals, and not leave the dissertation as an afterthought.

As per the research in [1], I made sure that the workshop had enough structure to cover all topics, but was also flexible enough to suit the students' needs as a group.

I belive that the workshop adequately covers all bases, as I gathered specific requirements for the issue directly from my team, did thorough research into the areas which needed attention, and presented the information in a way which fit in with the considerations I read about in my research.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

The one piece of quantitative feedback I will consider is the word count of their dissertation - note that this will include a dissertation plan. The main thing I hope to gain from receiving the word count from them each week is evidence that the team are actually doing something about the dissertation, and not leaving it until the last minute - as of the dissertation workshop, they had 0 words. I have access to their overlead template and will record the word count on the wednesday of each week from the workshop to the deadline of this coursework.

However, the main measure of success of this task lays in the teams confidence with their academic writing skills, and how proactive they are being in making incremental steps with their dissertation each week, which prompts much more of an emphasis on the qualitative feedback for this task.

I will gather some implicit data from their retrospective, gitlab issues, and weekly plans. Specifically, I will look for evidence that they are actively setting themselves dissertation tasks.

I will also gather some qualitative data through a survey with a mix of explicit yes/no questions, as well as open ended questions. I intend for each team member to fill this out. Here are the questions I plan on asking in my survey:

- Did you feel that the dissertation workshop offered adequate help in the following areas: 
    - identifying themes for dissertation
    - academic writing and referencing
    - write up of evaluation and testing
- Have you (as a team) kept up with weekly writing tasks?
- Have you applied any of the practices or principles discussed in the workshop to your dissertation work?
- Has your motivation towards working on the dissertation changed after the workshop?
- Do you feel that the workshop helped in distributing workload for the dissertation?
- How has the workshop influenced the team's collaboration and communication regarding the dissertation?
- Are there any things I could have improved about the workshop?

I believe these questions will help evaluate whether or not my workshop has addressed the issue, as well as raise points in which I could have done better.

<!-- Describe how you will evaluate the PIA.  State your objectives for the PIA. You should state any measurements that you will record, how and when you will record them and how you plan to evaluate them.  Measurements may be quantitative (lines code, for example) or qualitative (discussions during a retrospective, for example). -->

## Implementation Report

<!-- Provide an overview of the implementation of the PIA, including the dates, times when activities took place and the teams which participated.  Summarise problems or unexpected situations that arose during the implementation of the PIA.
Report any changes that were made to the implementation plan as a result of problems encountered during the implementation of the PIA.  Give the reasons that the changes were made, including any supporting evidence (qualitative and/or quantitative) that justified the change. -->

I carried out this workshop during their [weekly wednesday meeting](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/2566489b/cst-coursework-2023/-/blob/master/weekly-diary-16.md?ref_type=heads) on 21/02/24 at 1pm, in a room I had booked in the JMS learning hub. 
All members were present for the workshop, and 4/7 of them had looked through my own dissertation as a pre-requesite to the workshop.

After letting everyone get settled and giving a brief overview of how long we would be doing the workshop, I dove straight into the first task, which was about identifying dissertation themes.

I started by talking about the importance of finding meaningful themes in their own work, and referencing various academic pieces of writing with effective themes. I then went around the table in a stand-up fashion (a format they are comfortable with, and do weekly) and asked them to come up with three potential themes through these prompts:

- A feature or aspect of the project that they had personally worked on
- An area they felt the team had really excelled in
- An area which the team found challenging

After giving them a minute to think about it, I went around the group and wrote down a 'bank' of themes on a whiteboard. The informal nature of the workshop fostered a very collaborative environment, and every member had extremely meaningful contributions. Because everyone had worked on different aspects of the project, we had a very holistic view of the projects successess and failures, and the team **collaboratively** decided on an initial 6 key themes for their dissertation.

Next, I gave them a crash course in academic writing and LaTeX referencing.

Lastly, I spoke about the importance of having a plan for their dissertation, and making incremental additions to it over the next couple of weeks. I spoke about breaking it down into manageable chunks, EXPAND HERE. 

The only unexpected situation which arose from the workshop was from one of the

### Results

<!-- Present a detailed breakdown of the data gathered during the PIA.  You do not need to include the raw data gathered during the PIA, although you may include this in an appendix if you wish.  Rather, you should summarise the key results identified in the data, such as trends in quantitative data, or important themes gathered from qualitative data, such as retrospectives (include extracts from discussions as appropriate).  You can also use graphs to illustrate quantitative data. -->

I have created a graph to visualise the word count of their overlead template over the 4 week period.

As you can see

The implicit feedback I received was positive, as noted from their [fourth retrospective](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/team-project-h/2023/sh05/sh05-main/-/wikis/Retrospectives/Fourth-Formal-Retrospective-14.02.24). I also observed them actively having conversations about their dissertation in our weekly meetings, as well as engaging in discussions over teams.

As for the survey, here are the results:




On the whole, the feedback seems extremely positive.

## Critical Assessment

<!--  Develop A critical assessment of the success and/or failure of the PIA based on the data gathered during the exercise.  You should present an honest assessment of the PIA, identifying both successes and failures as appropriate.  Link the  discussion to evidence captured during the exercise.  Relate the evidence to other literature that covers similar PIA
   activities, such as similar case studies, text book descriptions of the PIA that include risks and benefits and/or industry white papers. -->
There are a couple of things about this whole exercise which, upon reflection, could definitely have used more attention.
The quality of the quantitative data through their overleaf word count has some potential issues, as there definitely may have been some confounding variables in collecting this data. For example, plenty of people do not write directly into overleaf - they may write in another template, and then paste their work into overleaf. 

There were also definitely some successes in the exercise.

I felt that the informal nature of the workshop really fostered

## Future Process Improvement Activity

<!-- Make a recommendation for a future process improvement activity.  This should be related to your insights gathered during this activity.  For example, if you found that pair programming was ineffective, is their reason to believe an alternative collaborative activity, such as continuous code reviews, or mob programming would be more effective.  Explain your reason for choosing an activity. -->
