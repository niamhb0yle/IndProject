## How to run/install
This is a react project made with next.js. To install and run the app, fork the repository and clone it to your personal workspace. Then, cd into the 'curo' directory:

```
cd curo
```

After you're in the curo directory, install all the apps dependencies, and then run the app! If it is running successfully, you should be able to access the app through your browser (I would recommend chrome) on port 3000.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
